const String story =
    """Once upon a time, there was a young man named Alex. He was born into a wealthy family and had never known anything but luxury and privilege. He had always been told that he was rich and that money could buy him anything he wanted.

As he grew older, Alex began to realize that his wealth brought him little joy. He had everything he could ever want, but he felt empty and unfulfilled. He had never had to work for anything in his life and had never truly accomplished anything on his own.

One day, Alex decided to take a walk in the park to clear his head. As he walked, he came across a homeless man sitting on the sidewalk. The man was dirty and unkempt, but he had a peaceful look on his face that Alex found intriguing.

Alex sat down next to the man and struck up a conversation. He learned that the man had once been wealthy and successful, but had lost everything in a bad business deal. Despite his current situation, the man was content and grateful for the simple things in life.

Alex was struck by the man's attitude and realized that he had been looking at wealth and success all wrong. He realized that true wealth and success come from being content with what you have and being grateful for the simple things in life.

From that day on, Alex changed his ways. He used his wealth to help others and to make a positive impact in the world. He found true joy and fulfillment in his life and was truly rich in every sense of the word.

The end""";
